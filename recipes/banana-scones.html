        <li>2 medium bananas</li>
        <li>  ½ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>  ¼ cup Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>  1 large egg</li>
        <li>  1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li> 3 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>  2½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>  ½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>  2½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>  5 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled</li>
        <li>  1 cup chopped walnuts, or more to taste
        
            <h4> For glaze:</h4>
        <li> ⅓ cup maple syrup</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
       <li> 1 cup confectioners' sugar, sifted</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Place bananas in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until mashed. Add brown sugar, yogurt, egg, and vanilla, beating until smooth. Add cinnamon, baking powder, and salt, beating to combine. Add flour, 1 cup at a time, beating just until combined after each addition. <strong>(Do not overmix)</strong></li>
        <li> Grate chilled butter into batter using a cheese grater. Beat to combine. Fold in walnuts using a rubber spatula. Drop batter by generous 1/4 cupfuls onto the prepared cookie sheet.</li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until edges and tops of scones are golden and a toothpick inserted in the center of a scone comes out with only crumbs, 17 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li> When scones have a few minutes left in the oven, combine maple syrup and butter for glaze in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until butter melts completely; do not boil. Remove from heat. Add just enough confectioners' sugar, whisking in a small amount at a time, to reach desired consistency for glaze.</li>
        <li>Drizzle glaze over scones using a spoon or whisk.</li>
    </ol>
